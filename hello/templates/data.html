                <p>Linked data is a method for structuring and connecting information on the web in a way that makes it more meaningful and useful. 
                    It's based on a set of principles and technologies that enable data to be linked, shared, and queried across different sources and applications. </p>
                <p>Linked data is employed in this project to integrate and enrich geo-annotated event data related to resilience in war situations. This approach facilitates data integration,
                    semantic enrichment, and advanced querying, 
                    enabling a more comprehensive and insightful analysis of the conflict's impact on public facilities and regions.</p>
